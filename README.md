# Community Event Log (Hacktoberfest friendly)

This repository collects community event details gathered from our Facebook posts. It's intended to be easy for contributors to add events (great for Hacktoberfest!).

Contributions should add a JSON entry containing the event details, a link to the original Facebook post, and the contributor name.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the schema and how to make a PR.

## Quick start

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add a new entry to `data/events.json` following the schema.
3. Open a Pull Request.

Thanks for contributing!
